I have grown comfortable using C/C++ from various units, most notibly using C++ looking at data structures and algorithms and also using C working with parrallel and distributed systems. Code here includes work from the following areas:

- Multi-Processing
- Multi-Threading
- Distributed Systems with MPI
- CUDA programming

I have spent alot of time learning Java right back at the start learning the key principles of OOP to now building larger applications. 

- The first example shows my contribution to a large 100 student class wide project building an application. I worked on the Database API
- The second example shows some more recent work building secure network applications using SSLSockets

Python is another language I have programed in throughout the course. From early programming principles, to introduction to machine learning with Scikit-Learn and Matplotlib. 

- When studying AI principles I used python to solve a puzzel the utilising Simulated Annealing Algorithm.

Learning Functional programming in Scala has been a big shift in how I think about programming.

- This collection of challenge exercises shows some of the functional programming techniques I've learnt

I have developed and understanding of Database structures and basic SQL to create database tables and query them.

- This project was building an SQL database schema and building and application in Java to access the database and add entries
