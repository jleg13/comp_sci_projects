## Description 

A collection of code from various projects during the last 3 years:

![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/c++-%2300599C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white)

I have grown comfortable using C/C++ from various units, most notibly using C++ looking at data structures and algorithms and also using C working with parrallel and distributed systems. Code here includes work from the following areas:

- Multi-Processing
- Multi-Threading
- Distributed Systems with MPI
- CUDA programming

![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/java-%23ED8B00.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=java&logoColor=white)

I have spent alot of time learning Java right back at the start learning the key principles of OOP to now building larger applications. 

- The first example shows my contribution to a large 100 student class wide project building an application. I worked on the Database API
- The second example shows some more recent work building secure network applications using SSLSockets

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)

Python is another language I have programed in throughout the course. From early programming principles, to introduction to machine learning with Scikit-Learn and Matplotlib. 

- When studying AI principles I used python to solve a puzzel the utilising Simulated Annealing Algorithm.


![Scala](https://img.shields.io/badge/scala-%23DC322F.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=scala&logoColor=white)

Learning Functional programming in Scala has been a big shift in how I think about programming.

- This collection of challenge exercises shows some of the functional programming techniques I've learnt

![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/mysql-%2300f.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=mysql&logoColor=white)

I have developed and understanding of Database structures and basic SQL to create database tables and query them.

- This project was building an SQL database schema and building and application in Java to access the database and add entries
